## Installation

To reproduce our simulation results, install our conda environment on a Linux machine with Nvidia GPU.

1. Install Isaac Sim

   Download Isaac Sim 2023.1.1. You can refer to the [official guideline](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/overview.html) and [Isaac Sim Forum](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/overview.html) to download it.

2. Clone this repo

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AlwaySleepy/Garment-Pile.git
    ```

3. Download 'Garment' Assets

    Please refer to [Google_Drive_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EWH9zYQfBa96Z4JyimvUSBYOyW615JSg) to download **Garment** folder and unzip it to 'Assets/'.

4. Install environment for PointNet++: (to do)

## Data Collection
Run the following command to generate retrieval data:
```
data_collection/retrieve_collect.sh
```
Run the following command to generate stir data:
```
data_collection/stir_collect.sh
```
Change the path of Isaac Sim to your own local path in all the shell files. <br>
Data will be stored in /data/retrieval or /data/stir in .npz form.


## Training
### Offline Training

### Finetune




## Evaluation
Run the following command to evaluate provided model.
```
/home/user/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac-sim-2023.1.1/python.sh eval/washmachine.py
```
Change the path of Isaac Sim to your own local path.
