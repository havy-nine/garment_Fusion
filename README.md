## Installation

To reproduce our simulation results, install our conda environment on a Linux machine with Nvidia GPU. 

1. Install Isaac Sim <br>
   Download Isaac Sim 2023.1.1. You can refer to the [official guideline](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/overview.html) and [Isaac Sim Forum](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/overview.html) to download it. 

3. Clone this repo
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AlwaySleepy/Garment-Pile.git
    ```

4. Download ClothesNet <br>
    You can refer to [Clothsenet](https://sites.google.com/view/clothesnet) to download this garment assets and put it in your preferred local path. Then you should change the path in /config.py accordingly.
5. Install environment for PointNet++: (to do)

## Data Collection
Run the following command to generate retrieval data:
```
data_collection/retrieve_collect.sh
```
Run the following command to generate stir data:
```
data_collection/stir_collect.sh
```
Change the path of Isaac Sim to your own local path in all the shell files. <br>
Data will be stored in /data/retrieval or /data/stir in .npz form.


## Training
### Offline Training

### Finetune




## Evaluation
Run the following command to evaluate provided model.
```
/home/user/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac-sim-2023.1.1/python.sh eval/washingmachine.py
```
Change the path of Isaac Sim to your own local path.
